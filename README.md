# E-commerce React POC

## Description

This is a proof-of-concept (POC) for an E-commerce web application built using React, Redux, and Material-UI. The application showcases various functionalities including a Product page, Single Product Detail page, Cart page, Checkout page, Success page, and navigation features like a side navigation and a navbar.
